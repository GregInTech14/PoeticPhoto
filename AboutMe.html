<h1>About Me</h1>




<p>Welcome, to an experience that brings together Poetry and Photography. 
    
    My name is Gregory, I am the creator of this serene place. 
    
    What made me bring these two worlds together you may wonder? For as long as I can remember, 
    I have loved poetry. 
    
    Something about how words can be manipulated and bring forth illustrations that compel certain emotions to be brought.


    Now as far as photography goes, 
    I always enjoyed editing pictures but didn't start taking photography seriously until 2016. 
    
    I have been hooked ever since. Capturing that one moment frozen in time till infinity. 
    
    Now, that's everlasting.
    
    I live for capturing the in-between moments that make up your story. 
    
    The moments youâ€™re sharing between two people or two hundred people. 
    
    I love freezing those moments and making them tangible so that you can look back and remember this time in your life. 
    
    As a result, 
    I merged the two poetry and photography to bring you, 
    Poetic Photo.
    
    A man, with his camera and his words.
    
    Enjoy!
